1) Time Complexity: O(n) - The recursive function calculateFutureValueRecursive is called n times, where n is the number of periods. Each call performs a constant amount of work.

2) Optimizing the Recursive Solution:

- Memoization: Store the results of sub-problems to avoid redundant calculations.
