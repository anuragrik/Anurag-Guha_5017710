1) Concept -Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

2) Simplification -Recursion can simplify problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. It is particularly useful for problems that can be divided into similar sub-problems.
