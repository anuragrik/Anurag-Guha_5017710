Represantation of Arrays in memory:

In Java, arrays are represented as contiguous blocks of memory where each element is stored at a specific index, and the array's reference points to the start of this block.

Advantages of array:

- Fast access to elements by index.
- For simpler cases where dynamic allocation is not required.
