Time Complexity:

- Add Operation: O(n) in the worst case to add at the end. O(1) if adding at beginning.
- Search Operation: O(n)
- Traverse Operation: O(n), visiting every node.
- Delete Operation: O(n) in the worst case.

Advantages of Linked Lists Over Arrays for Dynamic Data:

- Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically, as they are not fixed in size like arrays.
- Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Inserting or deleting nodes can be more efficient than in arrays because it doesnâ€™t require shifting elements. Only node references need to be updated.
