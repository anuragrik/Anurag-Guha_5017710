Time Complexity:

- Linear Search: Time Complexity: O(n)
- Binary Search: Time Complexity: O(log n)

When to Use Each Algorithm:

- Linear Search: Suitable for small or unsorted datasets where the overhead of sorting for binary search is not justified.
- Binary Search: When to Use: Best used with large, sorted datasets where faster search times are needed.
