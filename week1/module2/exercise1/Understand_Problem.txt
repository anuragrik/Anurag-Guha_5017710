1) Data structures & algorithms are essential in handling large inventories :

- Proper storage: Proper data structures allow for organized storage of large data.
- Fast retrieval: Well-chosen data structures and algorithms enable quick access.
- Scalability: Using proper data structures and algorithms makes the system scalable.

2) Suitable data structures for this problem include:

ArrayList: Good for maintaining an ordered list of products.
HashMap: Great for fast retrieval of products.
